GREGIS - Methods, instructions and data on geographical information about GREECE.

GIS data for Greece has been scarce. This project aims to provide methods, 
instructions and data for the construction of environmental and other maps 
of Greece with the help of open source GIS tools.

The Guide on the "Reproduction of the CORINE map with GRASS-GIS", 
corine_grass-gis_el.pdf, contains step-by-step instructions, in the 
Greek language, on how to use the map database CORINE to extract maps 
of land cover/use for Greece, with the aid of GRASS-GIS.

GRASS, Geographic Resources Analysis Support System, is a Geographic 
Information System (GIS) used for data management, image processing, 
graphics production, spatial modelling, and visualization of many types 
of data. It is Free (Libre) Software/Open Source released under GNU 
General Public License (GPL). GRASS is official project of the Open Source 
Geospatial Foundation.

CORINE is a high resolution public domain map database, maintained by 
the European Environmental Agency, EEA.

GREGIS will include a topologically corrected subset of CORINE containing 
the Greek terretory, which will accompany the Guide, and other GIS files 
of environmental and general interest.
